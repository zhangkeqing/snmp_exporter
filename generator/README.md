# SNMP Exporter Config Generator

This config generator uses NetSNMP to parse MIBs, and generates configs for the snmp_exporter using them.

## Building

Due to the dynamic dependency on NetSNMP, you must build the generator yourself.

```
sudo apt-get install build-essential libsnmp-dev snmp-mibs-downloader  # Debian-based distros
go get github.com/prometheus/snmp_exporter/generator
cd ${GOPATH-$HOME/go}/src/github.com/prometheus/snmp_exporter/generator
go build
```

## Running

```sh
./generator generate
```

The generator reads in from `generator.yml` and writes to `snmp.yml`.

Additional command are available for debugging, use the `help` command to see them.

## Docker Users

If you would like to run the generator in docker to generate your `snmp.yml` config run the following commands.

```sh
docker build -t snmp-generator .
docker run -ti \
  -v $HOME/.snmp/mibs:/root/.snmp/mibs \
  -v $PWD/generator.yml:/opt/generator.yml:ro \
  -v $PWD/out/:/opt/ \
  snmp-generator generate
```

## File Format

`generator.yml` provides a list of modules. The simplest module is just a name
and a set of OIDs to walk.

```yaml
modules:
  module_name:  # The module name. You can have as many modules as you want.
    walk:       # List of OIDs to walk. Can also be SNMP object names or specific instances.
      - 1.3.6.1.2.1.2              # Same as "interfaces"
      - sysUpTime                  # Same as "1.3.6.1.2.1.1.3"
      - 1.3.6.1.2.1.31.1.1.1.6.40  # Instance of "ifHCInOctets" with index "40"

    version: 2  # SNMP version to use. Defaults to 2.
                # 1 will use GETNEXT, 2 and 3 use GETBULK.
    max_repetitions: 25  # How many objects to request with GET/GETBULK, defaults to 25.
                         # May need to be reduced for buggy devices.
    retries: 3   # How many times to retry a failed request, defaults to 3.
    timeout: 10s # Timeout for each walk, defaults to 10s.

    auth:
      # Community string is used with SNMP v1 and v2. Defaults to "public".
      community: public

      # v3 has different and more complex settings.
      # Which are required depends on the security_level.
      # The equivalent options on NetSNMP commands like snmpbulkwalk
      # and snmpget are also listed. See snmpcmd(1).
      username: user  # Required, no default. -u option to NetSNMP.
      security_level: noAuthNoPriv  # Defaults to noAuthNoPriv. -l option to NetSNMP.
                                    # Can be noAuthNoPriv, authNoPriv or authPriv.
      password: pass  # Has no default. Also known as authKey, -A option to NetSNMP.
                      # Required if security_level is authNoPriv or authPriv.
      auth_protocol: SHA  # MD5 or SHA, defaults to SHA. -a option to NetSNMP.
                          # Used if security_level is authNoPriv or authPriv.
      priv_protocol: DES  # DES or AES, defaults to DES. -x option to NetSNMP.
                          # Used if security_level is authPriv.
      priv_password: otherPass # Has no default. Also known as privKey, -X option to NetSNMP.
                               # Required if security_level is authPriv.
      context_name: context # Has no default. -n option to NetSNMP.
                            # Required if context is configured on the device.

    lookups:  # Optional list of lookups to perform.
              # This must only be used when the new index is unique.

      # If the index of a table is bsnDot11EssIndex, usually that'd be the label
      # on the resulting metrics from that table. Instead, use the index to
      # lookup the bsnDot11EssSsid table entry and create a bsnDot11EssSsid label
      # with that value.
      - old_index: bsnDot11EssIndex
        new_index: bsnDot11EssSsid

     overrides: # Allows for per-module overrides of bits of MIBs
       metricName:
         ignore: true # Drops the metric from the output.
         regex_extracts:
           Temp: # A new metric will be created appending this to the metricName to become metricNameTemp.
             - regex: '(.*)' # Regex to extract a value from the returned SNMP walks's value.
               value: '$1' # The result will be parsed as a float64, defaults to $1.
           Status:
             - regex: '.*Example'
               value: '1'
             - regex: '.*'
               value: '0'
         type: DisplayString # Override the metric type, possible types are:
                             #   gauge:   An integer with type gauge.
                             #   counter: An integer with type counter.
                             #   OctetString: A bit string, rendered as 0xff34.
                             #   DisplayString: An ASCII or UTF-8 string.
                             #   PhysAddress48: A 48 bit MAC address, rendered as 00:01:02:03:04:ff.
                             #   Float: A 32 bit floating-point value with type gauge.
                             #   Double: A 64 bit floating-point value with type gauge.
                             #   IpAddr: An IPv4 address, rendered as '1.2.3.4'.
```

## Where to get MIBs

Some of these are quite sluggish, so use wget to download.

Put the extracted mibs in a location NetSNMP can read them from. `$HOME/.snmp/mibs` is one option.
